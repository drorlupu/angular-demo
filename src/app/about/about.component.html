<p>This is a sample angular app designed to demo some basic angular features.</p>
<br>
<p>The resources for this app were taken from:
    <ul>
        <li>Dog images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset, which in turn is based on http://vision.stanford.edu/  aditya86/ImageNetDogs/</li>
        <li>Cat images: https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/</li>
        <li>Heart breaking background stories were generated by ChatGPT</li>
    </ul>
<p>
<br>
<b><p>Note: All animal information displayed in this web application is fictional.</p><p>No animal was hurt/abandoned/mistreated. This is just a demo app!</p></b>
<br>
<p>
    The angular application is composed of the following features/modules/libraries, which are listed in no order of importance:
    <ul>
        <li>Inputs/Outputs/Angulr Directives</li>
        <li>Router</li>
        <li>Angular Material</li>
        <li>RxJS</li>
        <li>Express</li>
    </ul>

    On top of that, this represents the knowledge I acquired from the following resources:
    <ul>
        <li>https://angular-university.io/ (Angular Deep Dive and RxJS courses)</li>
        <li>Mini SideNav, with cool code: https://github.com/MeganRook18/mini-side-nav/</li>
    </ul>
<p>
<br>
<p>
    Instructions: Choose up to three lovley animals in the "Friends" tab, then click on the "Meet" tab to set a "match-making" meeting.
